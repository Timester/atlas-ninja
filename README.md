# AtlasNinja - A Leaflet-Based Choropleth Map in React
**A React application for creating interactive world maps with country-level data visualization.**


## Summary

AtlasNinja was originally an online service to explore facts about countries worldwide through interactive maps. While it is no longer available online, I am open-sourcing the project to serve as a template, library, or example for creating choropleth maps in React.

## Tech Details

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet 1.9 with react-leaflet
- **Build Tool**: Vite

Note: While I am not a frontend developer, I have done my best to create this app. Some parts might be unconventional or could be improved.

### Data

The project uses hardcoded data files located in the `public` folder:

- **`data.json`**: Contains the main country data (keyed by country ISO 3 codes).
- **`data_debug.json`**: A human-readable version of `data.json` for debugging purposes. Note: `data.json` is ~1.5 MB, while the debug version is ~2.2 MB due to formatting differences and this has measurable performance impact.
- **`geodata.json`**: Contains country borders in the [GeoJSON standard](https://geojson.org). The data comes from [this source](https://geojson-maps.kyd.au) (medium resolution, edited by hand for performance and accuracy).
- **`metadata.json`**: Describes data categories, their properties, and types used in `data.json`.
- **`/memberships/`**: Contains files describing organization memberships for countries (used for specific data categories).

### Known Issues

This project was initially built in early 2022 using `Create React App` with React 17. After migrating to `Vite` and React 18, some bugs were introduced:

- **Data Category Tooltip Issue**:  
  When changing the data category (top-left dropdown), the tooltip still displays "Area" data, regardless of the selected category. This appears to be related to map references in the code, but I have not yet resolved the issue.
